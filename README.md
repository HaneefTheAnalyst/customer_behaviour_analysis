🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project
🔍 Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to understand purchasing patterns, preferences, and key factors influencing sales. It follows a complete data analytics workflow—from raw data to insights and presentation.

The project includes:

Loading the dataset in Python

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaning and preparing the data

Running SQL queries in SQL Server

Building an interactive dashboard in Power BI

Writing an analytical report

Creating a presentation using Gamma

This project demonstrates my ability to work across tools and communicate insights clearly.
