# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to understand purchasing patterns, preferences, and key factors influencing sales. It follows a complete data analytics workflow—from raw data to insights and presentation.

##### The project includes:

* Loading the dataset in Python

* Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Cleaning and preparing the data

* Running SQL queries in SQL Server

* Building an interactive dashboard in Power BI

* Writing an analytical report

* Creating a presentation using Gamma

##### This project demonstrates my ability to work across tools and communicate insights clearly.
